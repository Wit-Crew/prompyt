1️⃣ Misspellings in the URL
What to check
Letters swapped or replaced: amaz0n, micros0ft
Extra dots or dashes: pay-pal-login.com
Why it matters
Scammers rely on people reading fast and missing tiny changes.
✅ Genuine site → exact spelling
🚩 Fraud site → small spelling tricks
2️⃣ Extra words in the domain name
What to check
Words like: login, verify, secure, support
Example scam: facebook-secure-login.com
Why it matters
Real companies don’t add extra security words in their main domain.
✅ Genuine → facebook.com
🚩 Fraud → facebook-login-help.com
3️⃣ Weird domain endings (TLDs)
What to check
Suspicious endings: .xyz, .top, .tk, .ru, .ml
Why it matters
Scammers prefer cheap, easy-to-register domains.
⚠️ Note: Not all are scams — but risk is higher when combined with other signs.
4️⃣ Web page cloning (fake copy of a real site)
What to check
Logo, layout, and colors look identical
Buttons don’t work properly
Login form redirects to strange URLs
How to detect
Right-click → image search → see if images are copied
Compare with the real website side-by-side
Why it matters
Cloned sites are used to steal passwords and card details.
5️⃣ SSL / HTTPS (🔒)
What to check
URL starts with https://
Click 🔒 → certificate matches domain name
Why it matters
❌ No SSL = unsafe, avoid
✅ SSL = encrypted connection
⚠️ Important: SSL does not guarantee legitimacy. Many scam sites use free SSL.
6️⃣ Checking genuineness by searching the real website
What to do
Search the brand name on Google
Open the official site (top result)
Compare domain name exactly
Why it matters
Scam sites cannot replace the real official domain.
Example:
Real: bankname.com
Scam: bankname-verification.net
7️⃣ Access to personal data (camera, location, mic)
What to check
Browser popup asking for:
Camera
Microphone
Location
Notifications
Why it matters
🚩 Huge red flag if:
A normal site asks for camera or mic
A login or shopping site requests location access
✅ Legit sites ask only when necessary (e.g. maps, video calls)
